**Language**: `Python`

**Lines of code**: `37`

## Description

This program, written in Python, utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of text input, providing valuable insights into the emotions expressed. It employs a pre-trained sentiment analysis model and incorporates additional features for enhancing its functionality. The program showcases the complexity of sentiment analysis and offers an interesting application of machine learning in understanding human emotions.

## Code

``` Python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def get_exchange_rate(base_currency, target_currency):
    url = f"https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{base_currency}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    return data["rates"][target_currency]

def convert_currency(amount, base_currency, target_currency):
    exchange_rate = get_exchange_rate(base_currency, target_currency)
    converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate
    
    return converted_amount

def main():
    print("Welcome to Currency Converter!")
    print("Enter the amount, base currency, and target currency for conversion:")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("> ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == "q":
            break
        
        amount, base_currency, target_currency = user_input.split()
        amount = float(amount)
        
        converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, base_currency, target_currency)
        print(f"{amount} {base_currency} = {converted_amount} {target_currency}\n")
    
    print("Thank you for using Currency Converter!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

## Prompt

```
Make me a program in any language that is more than 20 lines of code long and is complex and interesting.

When you create the program make a title for it and a short description of what it does.
